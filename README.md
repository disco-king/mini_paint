# mini_paint

My take on two programs from Exam rank 03 at 42. In case you're wondering, mini_paint was written first, and then changed to comply with micro_paint's subject/

These programs are not pretty, but they do the job. The repo also contains an example of an input file with a simple shell script to test my code with their_mini[micro]_paint.
